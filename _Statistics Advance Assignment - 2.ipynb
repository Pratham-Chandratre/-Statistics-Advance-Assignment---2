    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a powerful concept in statistics, but its validity relies on certain assumptions being met. While the CLT is quite robust and often holds in practice, it's important to be aware of these assumptions to ensure accurate and reliable application. The key assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Sampling: The samples must be drawn randomly from the population. This means that each observation in the population has an equal chance of being selected for a sample. Non-random sampling can introduce bias and invalidate the assumptions.\n",

    "Independence: The samples must be independent of each other. This means that the value of one observation doesn't affect the value of another observation. In the context of the CLT, this assumption ensures that the behavior of one sample doesn't influence the behavior of another, allowing the sample means to converge to a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finite Variance: The population from which the samples are drawn must have a finite variance (and, by extension, a finite standard deviation). If the variance is infinite, the CLT might not hold. This is often not an issue in practical scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Size: While not a strict assumption, the CLT works better as the sample size increases. The guideline commonly used is that the sample size should be at least 30 for the CLT to provide a reasonable approximation to a normal distribution. However, for highly skewed populations, larger sample sizes might be needed.\n",

In practice, the CLT tends to hold well for a wide range of situations, which contributes to its widespread use in statistical analysis. However, for critical analyses or situations where the assumptions might not hold, it's a good practice to consider alternative methods or assess the robustness of the CLT in that context.\n",
